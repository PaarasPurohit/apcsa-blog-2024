Hello! My name is Paaras. I am an AP Computer Science A student in Del Norte High School. My passions include computer science, software engineering, mechanical engineering, physics, music production, and animation. 

I started this blog to share my journey through APCSA. The type of posts you will find here consist of tool reviews and installations, lesson hacks that lead to one big project, and some extra code/code/coding I do.

My mission is to succeed in APCSA by going above and beyond in as many assignments as I can do. The only way to do this is to put my character and true personality into everything I do for this class. While I keep my consistency in the class, I also want to help out others in need whenever I can. Whether its explaining my code or debugging tools, I want to make sure that I help whoever I am able to.

Stick around to see some posts, connect with me on my social links, and have a great rest of your day!

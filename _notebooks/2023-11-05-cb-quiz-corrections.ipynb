    "Explanation: This would be the output if str was printed before the recursive call to whatsItDo(temp); instead of the System.out.println(temp); line which comes after the recursive method call. When the recursive call whatsItDo(temp); is executed, the current sequence of statements are paused. The call whatsItDo(“WATCH”) assigns to temp a substring of “WATCH” starting at 0 and ending at 4 – 1 or 3, which is “WATC”. Next the call whatsItDo(“WATC”) is made. The call whatsItDo(“WATC”), sets its local temp to “WAT” and calls whatsItDo(“WAT”). The call whatsItDo(“WAT”), sets its local temp to “WA” and calls whatsItDo(“WA”). The call whatsItDo(“WA”), sets its local temp to “W” and calls whatsItDo(“W”). The call whatsItDo(“W”) reaches the base case and doesn’t do anything since the length of “W” is 1. Then we need to finish the call to whatsItDo(“WA”), which prints the value of its local temp, “W”.  Then we need to finish the call to whatsItDo(“WAT”), which prints the value of its local temp, “WA”. Then we need to finish the call to whatsItDo(“WATC”), which prints the value of its local temp, “WAT”. Then we need to finish the call to whatsItDo(“WATCH”), which prints the value of its local temp, “WATC”. And the recursive calls are complete."

    "Explanation: The value of recur(9) is 18. However, this call was made within another recursive call and is not the final return value. The call recur(27) returns the value of recur(recur(9)) since 27 is greater than 10. The call recur(9) returns 18, since 9 is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, recur(recur(9)) is recur(18). The call recur(18) returns recur(recur(6)) since 18 is greater than 10. The call recur(6) returns 12, since 6 is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, recur(recur(6)) is recur(12). The call recur(12) returns recur(recur(4)) since 12 is greater than 10. The call recur(4) returns 8, since 4 is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, recur(recur(4)) is recur(8). The call recur(8) returns 16, since 8 is less than or equal to 10.  Therefore, recur(27)returns the value of 16."

The variable n is decremented by 1 and has the value 4. In the third iteration of the while loop, n is greater than 2. The variable x is assigned 3 + 2 or 5. The variable y is assigned 5 – 2 or 3.

    "\n",
    "Explanation: Please note that interface is no longer a part of the AP CSA exam.  Choice III provides the user with the getSurfaceArea and getVolume methods which provide the surface area and volume of a box. Unfortunately, a box with a smaller surface area or volume is not necessarily small enough to fit inside another box with a larger surface area or volume. For example, if box 1 has dimensions 1, 2, 5 and box 2 has dimensions 2, 3, 4. Box 1 has a surface area of 34 units squared and a volume of 10 units cubed.  Box 2 has a larger surface area of 52 units squared and a larger volume of 24 units cubed. However, box 1 cannot fit inside box 2 because it has a height of 5 which is greater than any of the dimensions of box 2. A rectangular box fits inside another rectangular box if and only if the height, width, and depth of the smaller box are each less than the corresponding values of the larger box. Choice I provides the user access to the height, width, and depth of a box through the accessor methods getHeight, getWidth, and getDepth. This allows comparisons to be made in each of the three dimensions to determine if one box can fit inside another box. Choice II provides the user with methods smallerHeight, smallerWidth, and smallerDepth that let the user know if one box is smaller than the other in each of the three dimensions. Choice III provides the user with the getSurfaceArea and getVolume methods which provide the surface area and volume of a box. Unfortunately, a box with a smaller surface area or volume is not necessarily small enough to fit inside another box with a larger surface area or volume. For example, if box 1 has dimensions 1, 2, 5 and box 2 has dimensions 2, 3, 4. Box 1 has a surface area of 34 units squared and a volume of 10 units cubed.  Box 2 has a larger surface area of 52 units squared and a larger volume of 24 units cubed. However, box 1 cannot fit inside box 2 because it has a height of 5 which is greater than any of the dimensions of box 2."

This would be the result if when words that started with “b” were found, they were added to the end instead of inserted at index animals.size() – k such as if the statement in the for loop was animals.add(animals.remove(k));. The manipulate method contains a for loop with a loop control variable k that starts at the right most index of animals, decrements by 1 each time, until k is equal to 0. In the first iteration, when k is 5, if the element of animals at 5 (“baboon”) starts with a “b”, which it does, then this value is removed from the list and inserted at index 1. The list would then be {“bear”, “baboon”, “zebra”, “bass”, “cat”, “koala”}. In the second iteration, when k is 4, the element of animals at 4 (“cat”) does not start with a “b” and no changes are made to the list. In the third iteration, when k is 3, the element of animals at 3 (“bass”) starts with a “b”. This value is removed from the list and inserted at index 3. Since it was already at index 3, the list would not change. In the fourth iteration, when k is 2, the element of animals at 2 (“zebra”) does not start with a “b” and no changes are made to the list.  In the fifth iteration, when k is 1, the element of animals at 1 (“baboon”) starts with a “b”. It is removed from the list and inserted at index 5. The list would then be {“bear”, “zebra”, “bass”, “cat”, “koala”, “baboon”}.  Finally, k decrements to 0 which is not greater than 0 so the loop terminates."

The variable k starts with the value nums.length – 1, which is the index of the right most element in nums. As long as j is less than k, x is assigned the value of nums[j], this ensures that the value of nums[j] is not lost when nums[j] is assigned the value of nums[k]. Then nums[k] is assigned the value of x. This algorithm swaps the values of nums[j] and nums[k].

    "Explanation: The size of the array is immutable. When the assignment statement is executed, no values are removed, but copied to the element to the left. The for loop control variable k starts with the value 3, is incremented by 1 and terminates the loop when its value is arr.length – 1. In the first iteration, when k is 3, arr[3] is assigned the value arr[4]. The contents of the arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7}. In the second iteration, when k is 4, arr[4] is assigned the value arr[5]. The contents of arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7}. In the third iteration, when k is 5, arr[5] is assigned the value arr[6]. The contents of arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7}. Then k is incremented to 6 and the loop terminates."

    "Explanation: This would be the return value if k was incremented by 1 instead of 2 and the loop condition was changed to k < input.length()- 1. The value of the loop control variable k starts at 1 and is incremented by 2 as long as it is less than input.length. In this case, input is assigned “computer”, so input.length is 8. The values of k are 1, 3, 5, 7, and then when k is 9, the loop terminates. The statement input.substring (k, k + 1) will return the value of input at index k. The values that are added to output in order are “o”, “p”, “t”, and “r”. The value “optr” is returned."

The seqSearchRecHelper recursive method does not work as intended when target does not appear in data. In this case, when last becomes -1, the method will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in the first if statement after line 1. To prevent this, we should add a check to see if last is less than 0 and if it is, return -1 as expected."

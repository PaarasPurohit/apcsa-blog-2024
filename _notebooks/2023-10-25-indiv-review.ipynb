    "[Time Box Progress](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcsa-blog-2024/time-box).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the problems I ran into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backend Run Failing.** This was due to commits made by one of the people working on the background template. However, after consulting with my teacher about this, we were able to resolve this issue and get it working.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of OOP in JS.** This was mainly due to my lack of practice using OOP in JavaScript frontend to fetch data from the backend. The issue was resolved by consulting with ChatGPT about how to make my code more object-oriented while still keeping the functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of Backend Implementation.** This was due to a team-wide lack of initiave on making sure that the backend worked. Due to this, it took longer, for example, for my Planet Weight Simulator backend code to be implemented into the backend. Even still, it does not completely work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debugging.** We are still in the process of debugging and testing to make sure our final website works for Night at the Museum as well as final ticket submission. This shouldn't be a problem, however, due to our backend now up and running properly."

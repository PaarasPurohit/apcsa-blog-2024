* [x]  Make Lab Notebook rows/columns for each week 0, 1, 2.  Make a hack (IPYNB) and review/exit ticket for each row.   Review student page as guide [Time Box](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/student/compsci), use Front matter and Jekyll system to create the page.
* [x]  Get  my github.io public site running.  This will work after GitHub sync.  Here are some key references for GitHub: [GitHub Sync](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/student/2023/08/26/GitHub_Sync.html)
* [ ]  Work on revising my IPYNB file(s) and add in my required Hacks.  Learn how to do  “Code Fencing”, “Code Cells”.  Revise  Linux Shell - Java Hello - Java Console Games IPYNB’s, prune and perform hacks to match my understanding.
* [ ]  Revise Home Page to only be a Lab Notebook Cover sheet,  Remove some of the content that I mistakingly put on this page regarding weekly plans and hacks …. move this information into my Lab Notebook rows/columns.
* [ ]  Work on adding a Project, my choice will be a JS Calculator and I will add it as an independent _post that will be in Week1 hacks of my Notebook.
* [ ]  Perform reviews on JS, specifically Inputs, Outputs, and APIs to be ready to support frontend on my future Java projects.

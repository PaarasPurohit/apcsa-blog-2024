| Instructions - Final project for individuals | Complete between Oct 25th through Nov 6th | [Runtime](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/team-premium-frontend/) |
|  |  Review early.  People that received a 1 on analytics check, could go early.   Show progress on student lessons.  Show plans for College Board Quiz and study.  Completed work is not necessary, the ability to show you will be completed is more impressive. | [Student Lessons](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcsa-blog-2024/apcsa-lesson-hacks), [Our lesson](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/team-premium-frontend/unit-7-arraylist),  [Frontend GitHub Analytics](https://github.com/PaarasPurohit/team-premium-frontend/graphs/contributors), [Backend GitHub Analytics](https://github.com/PaarasPurohit/team-premium-backend-final/graphs/contributors) |
|  | Iterative progress.  Showing how you iterate and have plans for completing the student blog is valued more than hurried completion in the last few days of the trimester. | [Student Blog](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcsa-blog-2024/), [Time Box](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcsa-blog-2024/time-box), [Our Student Lesson](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/team-premium-frontend/unit-7-arraylist), [Project Documentation](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcsa-blog-2024/2023/11/04/indiv-review.html) |
| Individual Code - Code that you can talk about, that shows your final project contribution.   Show code that you feel qualifies for Teacher requirements and demonstrates your learnings from the project.  It does not need to be done but shows your participation and accomplishment.   Make sure that I know you have prepared your thoughts before sharing!!! | Code contribution to the project.  Java is the primary ask, but well-structured OOP JavaScript can be used for first-trimester PBL.  Any discussions of CSS are not a part of individual scoring. | [Individual Review Proof of Frontend/Backend OOP](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcsa-blog-2024/2023/11/04/indiv-review.html), [Frontend OOP code](https://github.com/PaarasPurohit/team-premium-frontend/blob/main/AD_planet.md), [Backend OOP class](https://github.com/PaarasPurohit/team-premium-backend-final/blob/master/src/main/java/com/nighthawk/spring_portfolio/mvc/astronomy/PlanetWeight.java), [Backend API Controller](https://github.com/PaarasPurohit/team-premium-backend-final/blob/master/src/main/java/com/nighthawk/spring_portfolio/mvc/astronomy/PlanetWeightAPIController.java) |
|  | GitHub analytics review.  You should show how GitHub substantiates your work or claims of work during the trimester.   Be prepared to share KEY GitHub commits.  Talk about some of the challenges you faced in development in association with GitHub commits, Review tickets and analytics. | [Frontend GitHub Analytics](https://github.com/PaarasPurohit/team-premium-frontend/graphs/contributors), [Backend GitHub Analytics](https://github.com/PaarasPurohit/team-premium-backend-final/graphs/contributors) |
| Individual Blog - Code and materials that show your learnings for the trimester.  Be sure to update your Time Box and Blogs to represent trimester-long work. | Code in blog.  Java is the primary focus to check for this review, particularly how you have organized Student Lessons to show your learning. | [Student Lesson Teaching Hacks]() |
|  | Usage of blog.  The teacher should be convinced that you are using your Blog as a Study Guide for this course and future trimesters. | [Student Blog](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcsa-blog-2024//apcsa-lesson-hacks), [Time Box](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcsa-blog-2024/time-box) |

|  | Trimester 1 reflection. Memories and learnings from trimester 1. Reflective summary of things you learned, positive accomplishments, Reflective summary of things you intend to learn in future trimesters, growth opportunities. | Elaborated on below: |

### Tri 1 Reflection:

When I first came into the class, I had the mindset of improvement. The first two trimesters of APCSP last year were not successful whatsoever. However, in Trimester 3 of last year, I used my passions to succeed in the class. And I knew that I was going to continue to do so this year, too. I already knew Java from previous experience, so it was easy to grasp the concepts learned in CollegeBoard lessons. Some accomplishments I had were fully understanding backend-to-frontend connection, solving the dreadful CORS error that we all have had, being able to make projects that connected either to a backend I made or an API, and understanding/appreciating the language of Java that I had previously taken for granted. However, although this was a trimester of growth and improvement, it had some downs to its ups. That resulted in things I learned. One of these things was to choose harder projects. ChatGPT is good for coming up with basic ideas, but I plan to elaborate on them further to challenge myself and my team, which is possible now that I can use my tools well. Another thing I learned was to choose good and competent team members. In last year's trimesters 1 and 2, I had been in a group with those who either made the choices not to work the hardest, leaving me to try and put something together for our work, or those who couldn't help it, and as everybody else ignored said person, I quietly stepped in to help them, even if that sacrificed my grade. I have accepted it now, and plan to do a much better job at picking teammates to work with during the trimester. Finally, I would like to thank Mr. Mortensen, ChatGPT, my development tools, and some of my team members for a great trimester of learning and growth.
